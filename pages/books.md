    <summary style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:Gray">Reading philosophy</span></summary>

My reading preferences lean heavily towards non-fiction. I find true joy in discovering ideas that profoundly change my way of thinking and am constantly seeking books that introduce new mental models or frameworks that cut across multiple domains. From that standpoint, I've been more interested in multidisciplinary ideas in the recent past than ever before.

<br>
<br>
Over the years, I've come to realize that many books lack originality and don't offer much in terms of new ideas, considering their length. For this reason, I now preview books at the library first before deciding to buy them. Below is a list of books I've found to be exceptionally thought-provoking, each prompting me to buy a physical copy. I love re-reading them in my free time and if we're friends, you've likely received one of these as a gift from me.

Please note that the reviews for most of the books below are not complete. I'm in the process of updating them. :)

***Philosophy:***
 <details>
    <summary><u>The Beginning of the Infinity by David Deutsch</u></summary>

    <p> This is one gold mine of a book at the intersection of epistemology and modern physics. I can never forget how the concept of fallibilism in this book challenged my world view that justified beliefs/universal truths exist, and made me firmly internalize that theories are all there is within the vast body of human knowledge. I recommend reading it multiple times to be able to fully digest the dense ideas presented in this masterpiece.

    <summary><u>The Art of War by Sun Tzu</u></summary>

    <p> This ancient book is primarily about time-tested war strategies that military generals in China and powerful people across the world have been reading for centuries (Napolean to Mao Zedong to Bill Gates). But the text is much more than mere fighting tips - it is also about tact, leadership and human psychology. This is worth reading at least twice, once for the content and once for the beautifully-written phrases that seem contradictory at first, but underpin the mystical Taoistic truths. For instance, quotes like "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle", "Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak", “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” etc.

    <summary><u>Freedom from the Known by Jiddu Krishnamurti</u></summary>

    <p> Yes, it is the known world that causes us humans more troubles than the unknown. JK is an original thinker and his writings persuaded me revisit all the concepts I thought I knew about human emotions, desires and ambitions from scratch. This is another book I periodically revisit whenever I feel lost in direction. The beauty in JK's philosophy is that there is none. He is a strong advocate of thinking for oneself ("Truth is a pathless land", he said) and did so by boldly rejecting all sorts of "presciptions" from systems/traditions/gurus. Humans are always looking for prescriptions from others to follow in order to deal with their own sufferings. As such, the idea of thinking everything from scratch devoid of any dogma sounds terrifying. But, that journey is indeed the path towards true freedom according to JK, and I cannot disagree. </p></details>

***Science and Technology:***
<details>
    <summary><u>Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari</u></summary>

    <p> The beauty of Sapiens lies in weaving fascinating stories about the evolution of humans in a way that was not interpreted before. As much as I loved the content, which is fairly original, it is Harari's writing style that kept me hooked throughout and made it a memorable reading experience. I can see myself rereading this masterpiece in the company of nature on a fine vacation.</p></details>

    <summary><u>Cosmos by Carl Sagan</u></summary>

    <p>Detailed content goes here …</p></details> -->

<details>
    <summary><u>Godel, Escher, Bach (or GDB) by Douglas Hofstadter</u></summary>

    <p> This is a dense text and presents some deep ideas at the intersection of art, music and mathematics. TBD. </p></details>

<!-- <details>
    <summary><u>Gene, an Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee</u></summary>

    <p>TBD</p></details> -->
<details>

    <summary><u>This is your Brain on Music by Daniel Levintin</u></summary>

    <p> A detailed book on why we love music to why music evolved the way it did. A must read for those remotely interested in understanding the significance of music to humans from an evolutionary perspective.</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><u>Thinking fast, thinking slow by Daniel Kanheman</u></summary>

    <p> Who doesn't know System-1 and System-2? This idea of two systems has existed in the literature of psychology for sometime now but Kanheman popularized it so much so that it is part of most discussions about nature of modern day AI. </p></details>

***Investing/Entrepreneurship:***
<details>
    <summary><u>The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham</u></summary>

    <p> A classic must-read for both beginners and the experienced investors. </p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>The Bogleheads Guide to Investing</u></summary>

    <p> Bogleheads are all about a set of simple yet effective investment principles (see their <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy">investment philosophy</a>). This is an informative investing guide worth revisiting once in a while, especially when DCA with Index funds feels boring. The subtle art of investing, it turns out, finds beauty in the bland.</p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>The Geometry of Wealth by Brian Portnoy</u></summary>

    <p> What I love about this book is its holistic treatment of wealth as not just of money and investing, but also of our health, relationships and through the lens of our overall wellbeing. Sometimes when life feels like a unidimensional race, this perspective is important to be able to appreciate the other aspects of wealth that we usually take for granted.</p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>One up on the Wall Street by Peter Lynch</u></summary>

    <p>This is a quick read that helped me with useful tips on how to go about seeking the companies for investing and looking for trends in prospering businesses.</p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</u></summary>

    <p> Naval is sort of a modern day spiritual guru for the people in tech. A compilation of Naval's tweets, this is a small book filled with rich and dense quotes. </p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>Poor Charlie's Almanack</u></summary>

    <p> A collection of the great Charlie Munger's wisdom snippets, need I say more?</p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</u></summary>

    <p> The entire book revolves around the fascinating question of "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?". Little did I imagine this'd help me connect dots between the seemingly-distant pursuits of truth-seeking and running startups. No other book had as many fascinating ideas at the intersection of startups, truth-seeking and the nature of innovation as this one. Some are original, others are contrarian and some others are straightout nonsensical, but almost all of have certainly been thought-provoking. I will be revisiting this again and again in the future.</p></details>

    <summary><u>The Man who knew Infinity by Robert Kanigel</u></summary>

    <p>Full review <a href="/pages/book_reviews/TMWKI.html">here</a>.</p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman</u></summary>

    <p>Feynman is a fascinating personality not just because he's a physicist that won the Nobel prize renowned for his accessible lectures on advanced physics, but also due to his well-rounded life. While many academics grind their way into greatness, Richard did it all with a laid-back approach to his life while being a prankster, a bongos player and a tinkerer.</p></details>
<br>
***History:***
<details>
    <summary><u>The Discovery of India by Jawaharlal Nehru</u></summary>

    <p> A must read for those interested in the history of India from the perspective of an intellectual who happened to be at the helm of India's independence movement. I was positively surprised how well-informed Nehru was about the state-of-the-art developments in science amist all the turmoil in his life and in the world around him. </p></details>

<details>
    <summary><u>SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome</u></summary>

    <p> Roman history is one of the best-preserved ancient histories. It is fascinating due to the significant innovations across all spheres of civilization, from building gigantic structures like the Colosseum to sophisticated road highways, to great philosophies like Stoicism, and the creation of the Julian calendar, among many others. </p></details>

    <summary><u>Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss</u></summary>

<details>
    <summary><u>Antifragile by Nicolas Nassem Taleb</u></summary>

    <p>I like the concept of Antifragility that Taleb introduced in this book, although I don't think one needs to read this entire book to understand that concept. Just read a summary to understand the concept well enough and see how you can apply in your life.</p></details> -->

<br>

***Telugu:***

<details>
    <summary><u>Mahaprasthanam by Sri Sri</u></summary>

    <p> Perhaps the most popular and important Telugu poem collection written in the last century. Putting aside the Marxistic undertones, the striking descriptions of hope and human suffering in a provocative yet arresting tone is what makes it an original piece of art. Some of the expressions used in this book have become part of vernacular Telugu language and can also be heard today in movies, news, political speeches etc, a testament to the incredible influence it had on Telugu society.
