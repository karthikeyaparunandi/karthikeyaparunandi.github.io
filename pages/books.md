    <summary style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:Gray">My reading philosophy</span></summary>

My reading preferences lean heavily towards non-fiction, and I find true joy in discovering ideas that profoundly change my way of thinking. I'm constantly seeking books that introduce new mental models or frameworks that can cut across multiple domains. From that standpoint, I'm convinced that multidisciplinary ideas and knowledge (post on reductionism) is where the true gold mine is.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, I've come to realize that many books lack originality and don't offer much in terms of new ideas, considering their length. Consequently, I've developed a practice of previewing books at the library before deciding to buy them. Below is a list of books I've found to be exceptionally thought-provoking, each prompting me to buy a physical copy. I love re-reading them in my free time and if we're friends, you've likely received one of these as a gift from me.

    <summary><u>The Beginning of the Infinity by David Deutsch</u></summary>

    <summary><u>The Art of War by Sun Tzu</u></summary>

    <p> As the name says, this ancient book is primarily about time-tested war strategies that military generals in China and powerful people across the world have been inspired
    by for centuries now (Napolean to Mao Zedong to Bill Gates). But, the text is much more than mere fighting tips - it is also about tact, leadership and human psychology. This is worth reading at least twice, once for the content
    and once for the beautifully-written phrases that seem contradictory at first but underpin the mystical Taoistic truths. For instance, quotes like "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle", "Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak", “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” etc.
