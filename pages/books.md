    <summary style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:Gray">Reading philosophy</span></summary>

My reading preferences lean heavily towards non-fiction. I find true joy in discovering ideas that profoundly change my way of thinking and am constantly seeking books that introduce new mental models or frameworks that cut across multiple domains. From that standpoint, I've been more interested in multidisciplinary ideas in the recent past than ever before.
<!-- and knowledge (post on reductionism) is where the true gold mine is. -->
<br>
<br>
Over the years, I've come to realize that many books lack originality and don't offer much in terms of new ideas, considering their length. For this reason, I now preview books at the library first before deciding to buy them. Below is a list of books I've found to be exceptionally thought-provoking, each prompting me to buy a physical copy. I love re-reading them in my free time and if we're friends, you've likely received one of these as a gift from me.

Please note that the reviews for most of the books below are not complete. I'm in the process of updating them. :)

    <summary><u>The Beginning of the Infinity by David Deutsch</u></summary>

    <p> This is one gold mine of a book that I keep rereading to understand the dense ideas presented here better and come out with exciting insights in each iteration. I can never forget how the concept of fallibilism in this book shaked my world view that justified beliefs/universal truths would exist. After that point, there was no going back and I firmly internalized that theories are all there within the vast body of human knowledge.

    <summary><u>The Art of War by Sun Tzu</u></summary>

    <p> As the name says, this ancient book is primarily about time-tested war strategies that military generals in China and powerful people across the world have been inspired
    by for centuries now (Napolean to Mao Zedong to Bill Gates). But, the text is much more than mere fighting tips - it is also about tact, leadership and human psychology. This is worth reading at least twice, once for the content
    and once for the beautifully-written phrases that seem contradictory at first, but underpin the mystical Taoistic truths. For instance, quotes like "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle", "Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak", “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” etc.

    <summary><u>Freedom from the Known by Jiddu Krishnamurti</u></summary>

    <p> Yes, it is the known world that causes us humans more troubles than the unknown. JK is an original thinker and his writings persuaded me revisit all the concepts I thought I knew about human emotions, desires and ambitions from scratch. This is another book I periodically revisit whenever I feel lost in direction. The beauty in JK's philosophy is that there is none. He is a strong advocate of thinking for oneself ("Truth is a pathless land", he said) and did so by boldly rejecting all sorts of "presciptions" from systems/traditions/gurus. Humans are always looking for prescriptions from others to follow in order to deal with their own suffering. As such, the idea of thinking everything from scratch devoid of any dogma sounds terrifying. But, that journey is indeed the path towards true freedom according to JK, and I cannot disagree. </p></details>
