##### <span style="color:Gray">**About me**</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"> 
I’m an AI/ML engineer based in the SF Bay Area, specializing in decision-making for autonomous systems. In my previous life, I did [academic research](research.md) at the intersection of Reinforcement learning, and motion planning under uncertainty. My journey in the industry has taken me from developing algorithms for motion planning of robot arms at [Vicarious](https://www.vicarious.com/) (now acquired by Alphabet) and drones to my current focus on behavioral planning for self-driving cars at [Cruise LLC](https://www.getcruise.com/).<br></span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;"> 
At Cruise, I’m involved in developing large-scale ML algorithms that plan a car's maneuvers (such as lane changes, stopping/ yielding at traffic lights, making turns, etc.) ensuring that the vehicle reaches its destination safely, comfortably, and legally.<br>
What excites me about this field is that for the first time in history, large-scale autonomous systems are being deployed in a safety-critical application while interacting with the general public. Being at the forefront of this innovation challenges me to push the boundaries and advance the state-of-the-art in AI/ML.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;"> 
While not an engineer, I enjoy playing musical instruments, [reading books](books.md), playing board games and simply marveling at nature's beauty! :)

 <!-- In Robotics, this often involves planning robot's actions to achieve specific objectives - for example: <br>(i) a humanoid robot planning its limb motions in order to walk from one room to the another by avoiding potential obstacles<br>(ii) a drone navigating in a dense forest by dodging trees, or <br>(iii) a self-driving car planning its next set of manuevers such as lane changes, traffic light stopping/yielding and turnings etc. in order to reach its destination in a safe, comfortable and legal manner.</span> <br>  -->

<!-- I'm born in India and currently living in the beautiful suburbs of SF Bay Area. I'm an engineer by profession -->
<!-- I like doing the exercises of first principles thinking to demystify and share my thought process in the form of essays. -->
<!-- I believe short form content in social media, although maybe increasing information acessibility is killing original/first principles thinking-->
<!-- Some of my core beliefs:
- I am fully convinced that knowing oneself and their relationship with the world is the beginning of all wisdom (ahh...here we go, the good old "know thyself" adage!) (post on Karma/Gnaana/.. jeevam). And, for that, merely thinking or meditating at a corner is not enough. Right actions are a necessary step in helping us learn about our values, strengths and the limitations
