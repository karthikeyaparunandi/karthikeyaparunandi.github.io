# **About Me**

Hi :wave: I am **{{ site.author.name }}**, and this site is currently in progress. Check back later to see any interesting content!

<!-- I'm born in India and currently living in the beautiful suburbs of SF Bay Area.  -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Some of my core beliefs:
- I am fully convinced that knowing oneself and their relationship with the world is the beginning of all wisdom (ahh...here we go, the good old "know thyself" adage!) (post on Karma/Gnaana/.. jeevam). And, for that, merely thinking or meditating at a corner is not enough. Right actions are a necessary step in helping us learn about our values, strengths and the limitations
-   -->
<!-- My professional journey is summed up in the sketch below. More details at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthikeya-parunandi-896bb480/).
